# Exoscale Cloud Controller Manager

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/exoscale/exoscale-cloud-controller-manager/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/exoscale/exoscale-cloud-controller-manager/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

`exoscale-cloud-controller-manager` is the Kubernetes [Cloud Controller Manager][k8s-ccm] (CCM) implementation for Exoscale.
This component enables a tighter integration of Kubernetes clusters with the Exoscale Compute platform.

The Exoscale CCM implements the following [controllers][k8s-ccm-controllers]:

* Node controller: dynamically annotates Exoscale Compute instances registered as *Nodes* with platform-specific information (e.g. instance type, zone), and detects when a Compute instance previously registered as a k8s Node doesn't exist anymore and de-registers it from the cluster.
* Service controller: dynamically manages Exoscale [Network Load Balancers][exo-nlb-doc] with k8s *Services* of type [`LoadBalancer`][k8s-service-lb] to transparently forward traffic to k8s *Pods* running on  Compute Instance Pools-managed cluster *Nodes*.
