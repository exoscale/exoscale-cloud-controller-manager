# Kubernetes Services with Exoscale Network Load Balancers

This guide explains how to use the Exoscale Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) to
create Kubernetes *Services* of type `LoadBalancer`.

> Note: it is assumed that you have a functional Kubernetes cluster running the
> Exoscale CCM.

When you create a Kubernetes *Service* of type `LoadBalancer`, the Exoscale CCM
provisions an Exoscale [Network Load Balancer][exo-nlb] (NLB) instance, on
which it will create one [NLB *service*][exo-nlb-svc] for every
[`ServicePort`][k8s-serviceport-spec] entry defined Kubernetes declared in the
[*Service*][k8s-service-spec] manifest.


## Prerequisites

The Exoscale CCM service controller only supports managing load balancing to
Kubernetes *Pods* running on *Nodes* managed by Exoscale Instance Pools. We
strongly recommend that you build a [custom Compute instance
template][custom-templates] that is usable by an Instance Pool, for example to
automatically have the new members join your Kubernetes cluster as *Nodes*.


## Configuration

When the Exoscale Cloud Controller Manager is deployed and configured in a
Kubernetes cluster, creating a *Service* of type `LoadBalancer` will
automatically create an Exoscale Network Load Balancer (NLB) instance and
configured with a service listening on every port defined in the Kubernetes
*Service* `ports` spec.

The following manifest illustrates the minimal configuration for exposing a
Kubernetes *Service* via an Exoscale NLB:

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginxdemos/hello:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

The Exoscale CCM will create an Exoscale NLB instance containing a service
forwarding network traffic received on port 80 to the port 80 of the pods
matching the `app: nginx` selector.


### Annotations 

In addition to the standard Kubernetes [`Service`][k8s-service-spec] object
specifications, the behavior of the Exoscale CCM service node is configurable
by adding annotations in the Kubernetes `Service` object's `annotations` map.
The following annotations are supported (annotations marked by a __*__ are
required):


#### `service.beta.kubernetes.io/exoscale-loadbalancer-id`

The ID of the Exoscale NLB corresponding to the Kubernetes *Service*. This
annotation is set automatically by the Exoscale CCM after having created the
NLB instance if one was not specified (see section *Using an externally
managed NLB instance with the Exoscale CCM*).


#### `service.beta.kubernetes.io/exoscale-loadbalancer-name`

The name of the Exoscale NLB. Defaults to `<Kubernetes Service UID>`.


#### `service.beta.kubernetes.io/exoscale-loadbalancer-description`

The description of the Exoscale NLB.


#### `service.beta.kubernetes.io/exoscale-loadbalancer-external`

If set to `true`, the Exoscale CCM will consider the NLB as externally
managed and will not attempt to create/update/delete the NLB instance
which ID is specified in the k8s *Service* annotations.


#### `service.beta.kubernetes.io/exoscale-loadbalancer-service-name`

The name of Exoscale NLB service corresponding to the Kubernetes *Service*
port. Defaults to `<Kubernetes Service UID>-<Service port>`.

> Note: this annotation is only honored if a single port is defined in the
> Kubernetes *Service*, and is set to the default value otherwise.


#### `service.beta.kubernetes.io/exoscale-loadbalancer-service-description`

The description of the Exoscale NLB service corresponding to the Kubernetes
*Service*.

> Note: this annotation is only honored if a single port is defined in the
> Kubernetes *Service*.


#### `service.beta.kubernetes.io/exoscale-loadbalancer-service-instancepool-id`

The ID of the Exoscale Instance Pool to forward ingress traffic to. Defaults to
the Instance Pool ID of the cluster *Nodes* ; this information must be
specified in case your *Service* is targeting *Pods* that are subject to
[custom *Node* scheduling][k8s-assign-pod-node].

> Note: the Instance Pool cannot be changed after NLB service creation – the
> k8s Service will have to be deleted and re-created with the annotation
> updated.


#### `service.beta.kubernetes.io/exoscale-loadbalancer-service-strategy`

The Exoscale NLB Service strategy to use.

Supported values: `round-robin` (default), `source-hash`.

> Note: because Exoscale Network Load Balancers dispatch network traffic across
> Compute instances in the specified Instance Pool (i.e. Kubernetes Nodes), if
> you run multiple replicas of *Pods* spread on several *Nodes* the load
> balancing might be less evenly distributed across all containers – as the
> [`kube-proxy`][k8s-service-kube-proxy] also performs *Node*-local load
> balancing on pods belonging to a same *Deployment*. Similarly, using the
> `source-hash` strategy is not guaranteed to always forward traffic from a
> client *source IP address/port/protocol* tuple to the same container.


#### `service.beta.kubernetes.io/exoscale-loadbalancer-service-healthcheck-mode`

The Exoscale NLB service health checking mode.

Supported values: `tcp` (default), `http`.


#### `service.beta.kubernetes.io/exoscale-loadbalancer-service-http-healthcheck-uri`

The Exoscale NLB service health check HTTP request URI (in `http` mode only).
Defaults to `/`.


#### `service.beta.kubernetes.io/exoscale-loadbalancer-service-healthcheck-interval`

The Exoscale NLB service health checking interval in seconds. Defaults to
`10s`.


#### `service.beta.kubernetes.io/exoscale-loadbalancer-service-healthcheck-timeout`

The Exoscale NLB service health checking timeout in seconds. Defaults to `5s`.


#### `service.beta.kubernetes.io/exoscale-loadbalancer-service-healthcheck-retries`

The Exoscale NLB service health checking retries before considering a target
*down*. Defaults to `1`.


### Using a Kubernetes Ingress Controller behind an Exoscale NLB

If you wish to expose a Kubernetes [Ingress Controller][k8s-ingress-controller]
(such as the popular [ingress-nginx][ingress-nginx]) behind an Exoscale NLB,
some adjustments to its manifests are required in order for the CCM to be able
to provision a corresponding NLB instance correctly:

* Since the Ingress traffic will be load-balanced across multiple Instance Pool
  members, the Ingress Controller must either run on every cluster Node (e.g.
  using a [`DaemonSet`][k8s-daemonset] type of deployment), or the Ingress
  Controller Service `externalTrafficPolicy` property must be set to `Cluster`
  (not `Local`).


### Using an externally managed NLB instance with the Exoscale CCM

If you prefer to manage the NLB instance yourself using different tools
(e.g. [Terraform][exo-tf-provider]), you can specify the ID of the NLB instance
to use in the k8s *Service* annotations as well as an annotation instructing
the Exoscale CCM not to create/update/delete the specified NLB instance:

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: nginx
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/exoscale-loadbalancer-id: "09191de9-513b-4270-a44c-5aad8354bb47"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/exoscale-loadbalancer-external: "true"
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
```

> Note: the NLB instance referenced in the annotations **must** exist before
> the k8s *Service* is created.


## ⚠️ Important Notes

* Currently, the Exoscale CCM doesn't support UDP service load balancing due to
  a [technical limitation in Kubernetes][k8s-issue-no-proto-mix].
* As `NodePort` created by k8s *Services* are picked randomly [within a defined
  range][k8s-service-nodeport] (by default `30000-32767`), don't forget to
  configure [Security Groups][exo-sg] used by your Compute Instance Pools to
  accept ingress traffic in this range, otherwise the Exoscale Network Load
  Balancers won't be able to forward traffic to your *Pods*.
